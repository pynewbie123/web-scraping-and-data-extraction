WEB-SCRAPING-AND-DATA-EXTRACTION:

Web Scraping with Python (BeautifulSoup)
This Python program is designed to extract data from a website using web scraping techniques, with the goal of retrieving information from a specific table on the website. Here I will be using the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content of a Wikipedia page and extract data from the "List of countries and dependencies by population" table.

GETTING STARTED:
Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
